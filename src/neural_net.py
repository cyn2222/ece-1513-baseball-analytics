"""
Feedforward Neural Network model for MLB win prediction.

Based on Lectures 12–16 (NN representation,
universal approximation, backpropagation).

TODO:
    - Define WinPredictor network (2–3 hidden layers)
    - Implement train_nn() with configurable hyperparameters
    - Experiment with layer sizes, learning rate, epochs
    - Discuss whether the added complexity is justified on this small dataset
